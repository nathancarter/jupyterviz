<Heading>Purpose</Heading>

<P/>
Since 2017, it has been possible to use &GAP; in
<URL Text="Jupyter">http://jupyter.org/</URL> through the
<Package>JupyterKernel</Package> package. Output was limited to the
ordinary text output &GAP; produces; charts and graphs were not possible.
<P/>
In 2018, Martins and Pfeiffer released <Package>francy</Package>
(<URL Text="repository">https://github.com/mcmartins/francy</URL>,
<URL Text="article">https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08648</URL>), which lets
users create graphs of a few types (vertices and edges, line chart, bar
chart, scatter chart). It also allows the user to attach actions to the
elements of these charts, which result in callbacks to &GAP; that can
update the visualization.
<P/>
This package aims to make a wider variety of visualizations accessible to
&GAP; users, but does not provide tools for conveniently making such
visualizations interactive. Where the <Package>francy</Package> package
excels at interactive visualizations, this package instead gives a
broader scope of visualization tools.
<P/>
This is achieved by importing several existing JavaScript visualization
toolkits and exposing them to &GAP; code, as described later in this
manual.

<Heading>Terminology (What is a Graph?)</Heading>

<P/>
There is an unfortunate ambiguity about the word "graph" in mathematics.
It is used to mean both "the graph of a function drawn on coordinate
axes" and "a collection of vertices with edges connecting them." This is
particularly troublesome in a package like this one, where we will
provide tools for drawing both of these things! Consequently, we remove
the ambiguity as follows.
<P/>
We will say *charts and plots* to refer to the first concept (lines,
curves, bars, dots, etc. on coordinate axes) and *graphs* (or sometimes
*graph drawing*) to refer only to the second concept (vertices and
edges). This convention holds throughout this entire document.

<P/>
To support both of these types of visualizations, this package imports
a breadth of JavaScript visualization libraries (and you can extend it
with more, as in Chapter <Ref Chap="Chapter_extend"/>). We split them
into the categories defined above.

<Heading>The high-level API and the low-level API</Heading>

<P/>
This package exposes the JavaScript tools to the &GAP; user in two ways.
<P/>
Foundationally, a low-level API gives direct access to the JSON passed to
those tools and to JavaScript code for manipulating the visualizations
the tools create. This is powerful but not convenient to use.
<P/>
More conveniently, a high-level API gives two functions, one for creating
plots and charts (<Ref Func="Plot"/>) and one for creating graphs
(<Ref Func="PlotGraph"/>). The high-level API should handle the vast
majority of use cases, but if an option you need is not supported by it,
there is still the low-level API on which you can fall back.
<P/>

<Section Label="Chapter_Introduction_Section_Loading_the_package_into_a_Jupyter_notebook">
<Heading>Loading the package into a Jupyter notebook</Heading>

<P/>
To import the package into a Jupyter notebook, do so just as with any
other &GAP; package: Ensure that the kernel of the notebook is a &GAP;
kernel, then execute the following code in one of the notebook cells.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
LoadPackage( "jupyterviz" );
]]></Example>


<P/>
To see how to use the package, we recommend next reading Chapter
<Ref Chap="Chapter_high"/> on the high-level API, and if you find it
necessary, also Chapter <Ref Chap="Chapter_low"/> on the low-level API.
Each chapter contains numerous examples of how to use the package.
