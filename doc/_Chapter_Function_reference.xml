<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="script" Name="RunJavaScript" />
 <Returns>an object that, if rendered in a Jupyter notebook, will run <Arg>script</Arg> as JavaScript
</Returns>
 <Description>
If evaluated in a Jupyter notebook, its result, when rendered by that
notebook, will run the JavaScript code in <Arg>script</Arg>.
<P/>
When the given code is run, the varible <Code>element</Code> will be
defined in its environment, and will contain the output element in the
Jupyter notebook corresponding to the code that was just evaluated.
The script is free to write to that output element.
<P/>
This function is not intended for use in the &GAP; REPL.
 </Description>
</ManSection>


<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="filename" Name="LoadJavaScriptFile" />
 <Returns>the string contents of the file whose name is given
</Returns>
 <Description>
Interprets the given <Arg>filename</Arg> relative to the
<File>lib/js/</File> path in the JupyterViz package's installation
folder, because that is where this package stores its JavaScript
libraries. A <File>.js</File> extension will be added to
<Arg>filename</Arg> iff needed. A <File>.min.js</File> extension will
be added iff such a file exists, to prioritize minified versions of
files.
<P/>
If the file has been loaded before in this &GAP; session, it will not be
reloaded, but will be returned from a cache in memory, for efficiency.
<P/>
If no such file exists, returns <Keyword>fail</Keyword> and caches
nothing.
 </Description>

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="data[,code]" Name="CreateVisualization" />
 <Returns>an object that, if rendered in a Jupyter notebook, will run a script to create the desired visualization
</Returns>
 <Description>
The <Arg>data</Arg> must be a record that will be converted to JSON
using &GAP;'s <Package>json</Package> package.
<P/>
The second argument is optional, a string containing JavaScript
<Arg>code</Arg> to run once the visualization has been created. When
that code is run, the variables <Code>element</Code> and
<Code>visualization</Code> will be in its environment, the former
holding the output element in the notebook containing the
visualization, and the latter holding the visualization element itself.
<P/>
The <Arg>data</Arg> should have the following attributes.
<List>
<Item>
<Code>tool</Code> (required) - the name of the visualization tool to
use. Currently supported tools:
<List>
<Item>
<Code>anychart</Code>, whose JSON data format is given here:<P/>
<URL>https://docs.anychart.com/Working_with_Data/Data_From_JSON</URL>
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>canvas</Code>, that is, a regular HTML canvas element, on
which you can draw using arbitrary JavaScript included in
the <Arg>code</Arg> parameter
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>canvasjs</Code>, whose JSON data format is given here:<P/>
<URL>https://canvasjs.com/docs/charts/chart-types/</URL>
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>chartjs</Code>, whose JSON data format is given here:<P/>
<URL>http://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/usage.html</URL>
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>cytoscape</Code>, whose JSON data format is given here:<P/>
<URL>http://js.cytoscape.org/#notation/elements-json</URL>
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>d3</Code>, which is loaded into an SVG element in the
notebook's output cell, and the caller can call any D3 methods on
that element thereafter, using arbitrary JavaScript included in
the <Arg>code</Arg> parameter
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>html</Code>, which fills the output element with arbitrary
HTML, which the caller should provide as a string in the
<Code>html</Code> field of <Arg>data</Arg>, as documented below
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>plotly</Code>, whose JSON data format is given here:<P/>
<URL>https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-function-reference/#plotlynewplot</URL>
</Item>
</List>
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>data</Code> (required) - subobject containing all options
specific to the content of the visualization, often passed intact to
the external JavaScript visualization library. You should prepare
this data in the format required by the library specified in the
<Code>tool</Code> field, following the documentation for that
library cited above.
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>width</Code> (optional) - width to set on the output element
being created
</Item>
<Item>
<Code>height</Code> (optional) - similar, but height

<Section Label="Chapter_Function_reference_Section_Internal_methods">
<Heading>Internal methods</Heading>

Using the convention common to &GAP; packages, we prefix all methods not
intended for public use with a sequence of characters that indicate our
particular package. In this case, we use the <Code>JUPVIZ</Code> prefix.
This is a sort of "poor man's namespacing."
<P/>
<Emph>None of these methods should need to be called by a client of this
package. We provide this documentation here for completeness, not out of
necessity.</Emph>
<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="filename" Name="JUPVIZAbsoluteJavaScriptFilename" />
 <Returns>a JavaScript filename to an absolute path in the package dir
</Returns>
 <Description>
Given a relative <Arg>filename</Arg>, convert it into an absolute
filename by prepending the path to the <File>lib/js/</File> folder
within the JupyterViz package's installation folder. This is used by
functions that need to find JavaScript files stored there.
<P/>
A <File>.js</File> extension is appended if none is included in the
given <Arg>filename</Arg>.
 </Description>
</ManSection>


<ManSection>
  <Var Name="JUPVIZLoadedJavaScriptCache" />
 <Description>
A cache of the contents of any JavaScript files that have been loaded
from this package's folder. The existence of this cache means needing
to go to the filesystem for these files only once per &GAP; session.
This cache is used by <Ref Func="LoadJavaScriptFile"/>.
 </Description>
</ManSection>


<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="filename, dictionary" Name="JUPVIZFillInJavaScriptTemplate" />
 <Returns>a string containing the contents of the given template file, filled in using the given dictionary
</Returns>
 <Description>
A template file is one containing identifiers that begin with a dollar
sign (<Code>&#36;</Code>). For example, <Code>&#36;one</Code> and
<Code>&#36;two</Code> are both identifiers. One "fills in" the template by
replacing such identifiers with whatever text the caller associates with
them.
<P/>
This function loads the file specified by <Arg>filename</Arg> by passing
that argument directly to <Ref Func="LoadJavaScriptFile"/>. If no such
file exists, returns <Keyword>fail</Keyword>. Otherwise, it proceed as
follows.
<P/>
For each key-value pair in the given <Arg>dictionary</Arg>, prefix a
<Code>&#36;</Code> onto the key, suffix a newline character onto the value,
and then replace all occurrences of the new key with the new value.
The resulting string is the result.
<P/>
The newline character is included so that if any of the values in the
<Arg>dictionary</Arg> contains single-line JavaScript comment characters
(<Code>//</Code>) then they will not inadvertently affect later code in
the template.
 </Description>
</ManSection>


<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="filename, dictionary" Name="JUPVIZRunJavaScriptFromTemplate" />
 <Returns>the composition of <Ref Func="RunJavaScript"/> with <Ref Func="JUPVIZFillInJavaScriptTemplate"/>
</Returns>
 <Description>
This function is quite simple, and is just a convenience function
 </Description>
</ManSection>


<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="jsCode" Name="JUPVIZRunJavaScriptUsingRunGAP" />
 <Returns>an object that, if rendered in a Jupyter notebook, will run <Arg>jsCode</Arg> as JavaScript after <Code>runGAP</Code> has been defined
</Returns>
 <Description>
There is a JavaScript function called <Code>runGAP</Code>, defined in
the <File>using-runGAP.js</File> file distributed with this package.
That function makes it easy to make callbacks from JavaScript in a
Jupyter notebook to the &GAP; kernel underneath that notebook. This
&GAP; function runs the given <Arg>jsCode</Arg> in the notebook, but
only after ensuring that <Code>runGAP</Code> is defined globally in that
notebook, so that <Arg>jsCode</Arg> can call <Code>runGAP</Code> as
needed.
<P/>
Here is an example use, from JavaScript, of the <Code>runGAP</Code>
function.
<Log><![CDATA[
var calculation = "2^50";
runGAP( calculation + ";", function ( result, error ) {
    if ( result )
        alert( calculation + "=" + result );
    else
        alert( "There was an error: " + error );
} );
]]></Log>

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="libraries, jsCode" Name="JUPVIZRunJavaScriptUsingLibraries" />
 <Returns>an object that, if rendered in a Jupyter notebook, will run <Arg>jsCode</Arg> as JavaScript after all <Arg>libraries</Arg> have been loaded
</Returns>
 <Description>
There are a set of JavaScript libraries stored in the
<File>lib/js/</File> subfolder of this package's installation folder.
The Jupyter notebook does not, by default, know about any of those
libraries. This &GAP; function runs the given <Arg>jsCode</Arg> in the
notebook, but only after ensuring that all JavaScript files on the list
<Arg>libraries</Arg> have been loaded, so that <Arg>jsCode</Arg> can
make use of the functions and variables that they define.
<P/>
If the first parameter is given as a string instead of a list of
strings, it is treated as a list of just one string.
<Log><![CDATA[
JUPVIZRunJavaScriptUsingLibraries( [ "mylib.js" ],
    "alert( 'My Lib defines foo to be: ' + window.foo );" );
# Equivalently:
JUPVIZRunJavaScriptUsingLibraries( "mylib.js",
    "alert( 'My Lib defines foo to be: ' + window.foo );" );
]]></Log>

<Section Label="Chapter_Function_reference_Section_Representation_wrapper">
<Heading>Representation wrapper</Heading>

This code is documented for completeness's sake only. It is not needed
for clients of this package. Package maintainers may be interested in it
in the future.
<P/>
The <Package>JupyterKernel</Package> package defines a method
<Code>JupyterRender</Code> that determines how &GAP; data will be shown
to the user in the Jupyter notebook interface. When there is no method
implemented for a specific data type, the fallback method uses the
built-in &GAP; method <Code>ViewString</Code>.
<P/>
This presents a problem, because we are often transmitting string data
(the contents of JavaScript files) from the &GAP; kernel to the notebook,
and <Code>ViewString</Code> is not careful about how it escapes
characters such as quotation marks, which can seriously mangle code.
Thus we must define our own type and <Code>JupyterRender</Code> method
for that type, to prevent the use of <Code>ViewString</Code>.
<P/>
The declarations documented below do just that. In the event that
<Code>ViewString</Code> were upgraded to more useful behavior, this
workaround could probably be removed. Note that it is used explicitly
in the <File>using-library.js</File> file in this package.
<ManSection>
  <Filt Arg="arg" Name="JUPVIZIsFileContents" Label="for IsObject"/>
 <Returns><C>true</C> or <C>false</C>
</Returns>
 <Description>
The type we create is called <Code>FileContents</Code>, because that is
our purpose for it (to preserve, unaltered, the contents of a text
file).
 </Description>
</ManSection>


<ManSection>
  <Filt Arg="arg" Name="JUPVIZIsFileContentsRep" Label="for IsComponentObjectRep and JUPVIZIsFileContents"/>
 <Returns><C>true</C> or <C>false</C>
</Returns>
 <Description>
The representation for the <Code>FileContents</Code> type
 </Description>
</ManSection>


<ManSection>
  <Oper Arg="arg" Name="JUPVIZFileContents" Label="for IsString"/>
 <Description>
A constructor for <Code>FileContents</Code> objects
 </Description>
</ManSection>


Elsewhere, the <Package>JupyterViz</Package> package also installs a
<Code>JupyterRender</Code> method for <Code>FileContents</Code> objects
that just returns their text content untouched.
