<Section Label="Chapter_Using_the_low-level_API_Section_The_CodeCreateVisualizationCode_function">
<Heading>The <Code>CreateVisualization</Code> function</Heading>

<P/>
The low-level API is accessed through just one function,
<Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/>. You can view its complete
documentation in the function reference chapter (Chapter
<Ref Chap="Chapter_funcref"/>) for details, but examples are given in
this chapter.
<P/>
Nearly all visualizations in this package are created by passing data to
the <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> function as records describing
what to draw. Even visualizations created by the high-level API
documented in Chapter <Ref Chap="Chapter_high"/> call the
<Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> function under the hood.
Those records are converted into
<URL Text="JSON">http://www.json.org/</URL> form by the
<Package>json</Package> package, and handed to whichever JavaScript
toolkit you have chosen to use for creating the visualization (or the
default tool if you use a high-level function and do not specify).
<P/>
The sections below describe how to communicate, using
<Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/>, with each of the visualization tools
this package makes available.
<P/>
</Section>


<Section Label="Chapter_Using_the_low-level_API_Section_Looking_beneath_the_high-level_API">
<Heading>Looking beneath the high-level API</Heading>

<P/>
There are a few techniques for taking a call to the high-level API
(either to <Ref Func="Plot"/> or <Ref Func="PlotGraph"/>) and computing
what data it eventally passes to <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/>. This
is a great starting point for learning the data formats that
<Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> expects, in preparation for either
tweaking them or creating them from scratch. We cover two examples here.
<P/>
<Subsection Label="Chapter_Using_the_low-level_API_Section_Looking_beneath_the_high-level_API_Subsection_Looking_beneath_CodePlotCode">
<Heading>Looking beneath <Code>Plot</Code></Heading>

<P/>
Assume that you have a plot that you're creating with the high-level
API, like the following example.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
Plot( x -> x^0.5, rec( tool := "canvasjs" ) );
]]></Log>


<P/>
You can find out what kind of data is being passed, under the hood, to
<Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> by running the following code.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
dataSeries := JUPVIZMakePlotDataSeries( x -> x^0.5 );;
big := ConvertDataSeriesForTool.canvasjs( [ dataSeries ] );
# yields:
# rec(
#     animationEnabled := true,
#     data := [
#         rec(
#             dataPoints := [
#                 rec( x := 1, y := 1 ),
#                 rec( x := 2, y := 1.4142135623730951 ),
#                 rec( x := 3, y := 1.7320508075688772 ),
#                 rec( x := 4, y := 2. ),
#                 rec( x := 5, y := 2.2360679774997898 )
#             ],
#             type := "line"
#         )
#     ],
#     height := 400
# )
]]></Log>


<P/>
That record is passed to <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> with a call
like the following.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
CreateVisualization( rec( tool := "canvasjs", data := big ) );
]]></Log>


<P/>
If you wanted to change any of the internal options, such as the
default <Code>animationEnabled := true</Code> or the default
<Code>height := 400</Code>, you could alter the record yourself before
passing it on to <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/>.
<P/>
Such options may be specific to the tool you've chosen, and are
not guaranteed to work with other tools. For example, you can't
change `"canvasjs"` to `"anychart"` and expect the
<Code>animationEnabled</Code> setting to work, because it is specific
to CanvasJS. See Section <Ref Sect="Section_tooldocs"/> for links to
each tool's documentation, which give detailed data formats.
<P/>
If you had researched other options about CanvasJS and wanted to
include those, you could do so as well, as shown below.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
big.animationEnabled := false;;     # changing an option
big.height := 500;;                 # changing an option
big.backgroundColor := "#F5DEB3";;  # adding an option
CreateVisualization( rec( tool := "canvasjs", data := big ) );

<Heading>Looking beneath <Code>PlotGraph</Code></Heading>

<P/>
In the previous section, we saw how you could take a call to
<Ref Func="Plot"/> and find out what data that call would pass to
<Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/>. You can do the same with
<Ref Func="PlotGraph"/>, but it takes a few more steps.
<P/>
First, we you must have a list of your graph's vertices. Here we will
assume it is in a variable called <Code>vertices</Code>. Second, you
must have a list of your graph's edges. Similarly, we will assume it is
in a variable called <Code>edges</Code>.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
vertices := [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
edges := [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 2, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ] ];
]]></Log>


<P/>
You can then convert your graph into the format passed to
<Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> as follows. Note that at the time of
this writing, there is only one graph visualization tool, cytoscape,
so we use that one directly.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
big := ConvertGraphForTool.cytoscape( rec(
    vertices := vertices,
    edges := edges,
    options := rec() # or any options you like here
) );
# yields:
# rec(
#     elements := [
#         rec( data := rec( id := "1" ) ),
#         rec( data := rec( id := "2" ) ),
#         rec( data := rec( id := "3" ) ),
#         rec( data := rec( id := "4" ) ),
#         rec( data := rec( source := "1", target := "2" ) ),
#         rec( data := rec( source := "2", target := "3" ) ),
#         rec( data := rec( source := "2", target := "4" ) )
#     ],
#     layout := rec( name := "cose" ),
#     style := [
#         rec(
#             selector := "node",
#             style := rec( content := "data(id)" )
#         )
#     ]
# )
]]></Log>


<P/>
That record is passed to <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> with a call
like the following. Note the inclusion of a default height, if you
don't provide one.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
CreateVisualization( rec(
    tool := "cytoscape", data := big, height := 400
) );
]]></Log>


<P/>
If you wanted to change any of the internal options, including
creating elements not supported by the simple high-level API,
you could alter or recreate the contents of the <Code>big</Code> record.
We do so here, using features we could learn from the cytoscape JSON
format reference, linked to in Section <Ref Sect="Section_tooldocs"/>.

<Heading>Using JSON from a file</Heading>

<P/>
As the documentation linked to in Section <Ref Sect="Section_tooldocs"/>
states, all of the underlying visualization tools used by this package
accept input in JSON form. You might have some data in that form
generated by another source or downloaded from the web. For example, in
this package's directory, the file
<File>example/EV Charge Points.json</File> contains JSON data from one of
<URL Text="the Plotly project's blog posts">https://medium.com/&#64;plotlygraphs/leading-the-charge-10-charts-on-electric-vehicles-in-plotly-d951acdc49c1</URL>.
<P/>
You can load it and use it in a visualization as follows.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
# read file and convert JSON into a GAP record
jsonText := ReadAll( InputTextFile( "EV Charge Points.json" ) );;
gapRecord := JsonStringToGap( jsonText );;

if IsBound( gapRecord.layout ) then
    gapRecord.layout.height := 500;;

<Heading>Example: AnyChart</Heading>

<P/>
Following the conventions in the AnyChart documentation linked to in the
previous section, we could give AnyChart the following JSON to produce a
pie chart.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
{
    "chart" : {
        "type" : "pie",
        "data" : [

        ]

<P/>
In &GAP;, the same data would be represented with a record, as follows.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
myChartData := rec(
    chart := rec(
        type := "pie",
        data := [

<Heading>Example: Cytoscape</Heading>

<P/>
Unlike AnyChart, which is for charts and plots, Cytoscape is for graph
drawing. A tiny Cytoscape graph (just <Math>A\to B</Math>) is represented by the
following JSON.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
{
    elements : [
        { data : { id : "A" } },

    ],
    layout : { name : "grid", rows : 1 }
}
]]></Log>


<P/>
Cytoscape graphs can also have style attributes not shown here.
Refer to its documentation, linked to in the previous section.
<P/>
Rather than copy this data directly into &GAP;, let's generate graph
data in the same format using &GAP; code. Here we make a graph of the
first 50 positive integers, with <Math>n\to m</Math> iff <Math>n\mid m</Math> (ordinary integer
divisibility).
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
N := 50;
elements := [ ];
for i in [2..N] do
    Add( elements, rec( data := rec( id := String( i ) ) ) );

<P/>
We then need to choose a layout algorithm. The Cytoscape documentation
suggests that the "cose" layout works well as a force-directed layout.
Here, we do choose a height (in pixels) for the result, because
Cytoscape does not automaticlly resize visualizations to fit their
containing HTML element. We also set the style for each node to display
its ID (which is the integer associated with it).
