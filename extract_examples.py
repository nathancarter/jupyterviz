# This is a simple python script to look through all the GAP code
# and documentation in the lib/ folder of this repository, find
# all example code snippets, and extract them all into a single
# Jupyter Notebook.

# The resulting notebook can then be loaded and the user can
# manually run one or more of the code snippets.  This is useful
# when generating visualizations that will then be included in the
# original manual, to show the results of the code snippets.

# This script is to be run without parameters.  It finds all the
# lib/*.gd files and processes them in alphabetical order by
# filename.
